Deprecated in favor of Ember CLI
==================
Ember App Kit has been deprecated and is moving people towards the Ember CLI project; which offers better structure and build tools. Please use it instead.

TodoMVC demo using Ember App Kit
------------------

This is a simple demo implementation of the official [Ember's Todo MVC](http://jsbin.com/aZIXaYo/1) app from the [guides section](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) using the [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/) to organize the files and build the project.

A guide explaining the differences between the official guide vs using App Kit should be coming soon.

Feel free to send pull requests with code suggestions, tests and other versions of this code (using coffee-script, emblem, etc).

```
git clone https://github.com/neojp/TodoMVC-EAK.git
cd TodoMVC-EAK
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
npm install
grunt server
```
